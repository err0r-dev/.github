### 🧠 What is err0r.dev?
**err0r.dev** is a collection of my tools, experiments, and random bursts of code, all completely **vibe-coded** to make my life easier (and occasionally yours too).

Sometimes it’s automation.  
Sometimes it’s chaos.  
Always: a vibe.

If it looks broken, it’s probably meant to be that way.  
If it works — even better.  
Vibe coding all the way ✨
